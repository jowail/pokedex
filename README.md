## Pokedex
A passion project still in the making because I love pokemon and I think their wikipedia page is too cluttered with unnecessary information.
[Live site](https://personalpokedex-one.vercel.app/)
Inspired by [David](https://github.com/davidhckh)
[PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

## TODO
- add pages per generation
- add page to save pokemon in (team)
- a route to each pokemon to display all stats
- type filter
